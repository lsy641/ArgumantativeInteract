He has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants. Now what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good because that employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans wages. And Donald knows a lot about this, he used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained he basically said what a lot of employers do: You complain I'll get you deported. I want to get everybody out of the shadows get the economy working and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers which hurts them but also hurts American workers.",
