Now what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good because that employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans wages. And Donald knows a lot about this, he used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained he basically said what a lot of employers do: You complain I'll get you deported.

Now the second study was most comprehensive study ever conducted exploring the relationship between food and the environment. And it said that in this country, in the UK, we have to reduce our beef, our lamb, and our pig consumption by 90 percent, and our dairy and poultry and egg consumption by 60 percent, to not hit that 1.5 degree threshold rise in twelve years' time.",
