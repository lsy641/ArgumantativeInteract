    "Content": "we know what happened at uvaldo there were hundreds of good guys with guns and none of them had the guts to go and think about it and 20 kids got killed so it's not a given that actually if you have a load of people who are good people with guns in these schools it makes any difference we saw what happened on the video here about what this person did but on a wider point I I tweeted today for example look rather than get into the same old debates what about uh regulating guns in America as in the same way you regulate cars and I got an unbelievable amount of abuse immediately just endless abuse as if I didn't know what I was talking about but when I actually then posted a piece by Nick Kristoff who was at the New York Times at the time and I explained what I meant and I'm just going to pre-see what the piece was a brilliant piece it was a few years ago but he said if we had the same Auto fatality rate today that we had in 1921 by my calculations we'd have we'd have 715 000 Americans dying annually in vehicle accidents instead we've reduced that fatality rate by 95 percent not by confiscating cars or taking them away but by regulating them and their drivers more sensibly and then he goes into all the things that have happened in that period right they talked about requiring driver licenses uh putting speed limits registering Vehicles all of that was originally met with ridicule when authorities in New York City saw in 1899 to ban Horseless carriages in the Parks the idea was lambasted as devoid of Merit and impossible to maintain by the New York Times yeah over time as more and more people were being killed by cars they brought in more and more regulation by the 1920s a lot of this stuff like car registration license requirements other safety measures and then over time seat belts airbags padded dashboards better bumpers rules about drunken drivers graduated licensing the young people improved Road engineering blah blah blah the upshot of all that was that there's now just over one car fatality per 100 million miles driven and so it was a very well argued point and at the center of it was not a claim which I know goes down very badly with gun owners in America that you want to ban guns or grab guns I'm always going to gun Grabber. I don't want your guns, trust me. But about making it as safe as cars, why not just do that and see what happens.",

    "Content": "Well, here's the thing: somebody that's going to go into a school and murder children is not like your average driver who needs to obey a speed limit or wear a seat belt. Somebody that's going to go in to murder students clearly does not care about laws in general. So what does making law-abiding citizens making it harder for us to have firearms do to stop a monster, a psychopath, a freak? Now, I understand your argument here, so we need gun safety. We need people to be trained how to use firearms, to respect firearms, and change the gun culture in this country. I'll also say that in the last 30 years, gun ownership in the United States really has not changed much. What has? Our mental health situation. And now, thanks to the radical LGBTQ movement in this country, we are exploiting mental illness, especially in young people. So, when you look at this particular shooter, you look at their background, you look at the mental health counseling and services they were receiving, probably gender affirmation, because that's the new status quo now. Instead of saying this person has a real mental illness that needs to be addressed on an individual basis, we cloud everything under the guise of gender affirmation and tolerance. The mental health aspect is very important. Okay, we got a lot of discussion about gun safety. Okay, to address mental health, and that's being glossed over.",
