But an abortion doesn't unrape a woman and abortion just adds more violence on top of that that first violence that she endured and you look at the stories of someone like rebecca kiesling a woman who was conceived in rape. She says should I have received the death penalty for the crimes of my father? I mean if your father did something bad in his life should you receive the crime should you receive the the penalty for his crime? That's not fair. I mean I think all of this comes down to this question what is the life in the room, what is the life in the womb. Is it a human life? Is it a life sciences? We should recognize the human rights of this whole group of people that we've denied rights for. So we're dismembering them. We're poisoning them. We're ripping them apart.

Conservatives always say they want fewer abortions progressives. We can all agree on that. So there's a whole laundry list of things that we know reduce the need for abortions in America. Let's start with sex education and contraception and what about raising the minimum wage among other things that would allow women to afford to raise children.
