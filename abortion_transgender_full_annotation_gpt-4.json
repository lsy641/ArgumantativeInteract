So I want to equal pay the kinds of things you're talking about. I agree with women need to make informed choices i want to pick up on where you're going lila and where you went newt because there's a way in which folks who are opposed to abortion try to portray a sort of focus on later term abortions to kind of paint this extreme picture of what elisa said her majority vast majority over 99 abortions in earlier in the pregnancy.",

The woman needs healing and the support of her community. But an abortion doesn't unrape a woman and abortion just adds more violence on top of that that first violence that she endured and you look at the stories of someone like rebecca kiesling a woman who was conceived in rape. She says should I have received the death penalty for the crimes of my father? I mean if your father did something bad in his life should you receive the crime should you receive the the penalty for his crime? That's not fair. I mean I think all of this comes down to this question what is the life in the room, what is the life in the womb. Is it a human life? Is it a life sciences? We should recognize the human rights of this whole group of people that we've denied rights for. So we're dismembering them. We're poisoning them. We're ripping them apart.

Today for the 41 years in a row, abortion remains to be constitutional, a fact that continues to frustrate the right wing. But here's what frustrates me. Conservatives always say they want fewer abortions progressives. We can all agree on that. So there's a whole laundry list of things that we know reduce the need for abortions in America. Let's start with sex education and contraception and what about raising the minimum wage among other things that would allow women to afford to raise children. So if conservatives really want to reduce the number of abortions in America. Why are they opposing these policies that should be at the top of their agenda?",

There's even vanity fair exposing the nuva ring which was promoted by planned parenthood. No one's talking about the risk to women of these drugs. Even the world health organization called them a group one carcinogen. I mean that's the kind of thing that women deserve to know right up there with the dangers of abortion.

That is something you not blame on trans women. Although you were not saying that, when we talk about predatory behavior and when we talk about the predatory cases, none of them have been trans women. So I just want to make sure. I know she's not strictly doing that. But because she said that. I think it's very important that I bring that out on the table and discuss that.",
