I agree with women need to make informed choices i want to pick up on where you're going lila and where you went newt because there's a way in which folks who are opposed to abortion try to portray a sort of focus on later term abortions to kind of paint this extreme picture of what elisa said her majority vast majority over 99 abortions in earlier in the pregnancy.",

The woman needs healing and the support of her community. But an abortion doesn't unrape a woman and abortion just adds more violence on top of that that first violence that she endured and you look at the stories of someone like rebecca kiesling a woman who was conceived in rape. She says should I have received the death penalty for the crimes of my father? I mean if your father did something bad in his life should you receive the crime should you receive the the penalty for his crime? That's not fair. I mean I think all of this comes down to this question what is the life in the room, what is the life in the womb. Is it a human life? Is it a life sciences? We should recognize the human rights of this whole group of people that we've denied rights for. So we're dismembering them. We're poisoning them. We're ripping them apart.

Conservatives always say they want fewer abortions progressives. We can all agree on that. So there's a whole laundry list of things that we know reduce the need for abortions in America. Let's start with sex education and contraception and what about raising the minimum wage among other things that would allow women to afford to raise children.

There's even vanity fair exposing the nuva ring which was promoted by planned parenthood. No one's talking about the risk to women of these drugs. Even the world health organization called them a group one carcinogen. I mean that's the kind of thing that women deserve to know right up there with the dangers of abortion.
