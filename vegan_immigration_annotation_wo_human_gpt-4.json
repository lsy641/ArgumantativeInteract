He has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants. Now what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good because that employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans wages. And Donald knows a lot about this, he used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained he basically said what a lot of employers do: You complain I'll get you deported. I want to get everybody out of the shadows get the economy working and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers which hurts them but also hurts American workers.",

The Rubio Schumer amnesty plan passed the Senate and it was on the verge of passing the House house leadership intended to take it up and pass it with the Democrats overruling most of the Republicans and the question for anyone on illegal immigration is where were you in that fight, where did you stand you. There is a difference between me and senator Rubio.",

Not only that he proposed doubling the number of green cards, he proposed a 500% increase on guest workers now his position is different. Now he is a passionate opponent of all those things so he either wasn't telling the truth then or he isn't telling the truth now but to argue he's a purist on immigration",

In addition to that Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama's illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.
